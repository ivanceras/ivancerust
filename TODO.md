##TODO:

~~implement a screen ray vectors aligned with the voxel in subject orientation~~

~~cargofy the project~~

Save voxelized voxel octree into a file to save computation time of on the spot objects.

~~Add colors~~ and normals to the voxel array


Use quarternions on camera rotations

1. ~~Indexes are not soo efficient~~
   ~~We can replace it make a sorted indexes and lookups.~~
    
2. Find the relationship between indexes and the bits at each LOD, these can tell if the voxel is occupied or not


Arrays of 8bits or arrays of 64bits.
Each voxel can be contained either by 64bits or 8bits. A long list of 8bits or 1/8th less of 64bits.


Feb 18:

* ~~Voxel colors should have its own array of colors for each indexes~~
* and so with the normals

8bits indexing is ideal and easier to think about it
No need for sorting the indexes, since we can compare morton code which one is greate or not by decoding back the morton then calculating the xyz index

Use opengl instead of ppm files to render the pixels

Feb 25:
Correct the parent voxel implementation, seems odd.
