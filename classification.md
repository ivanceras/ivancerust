##Shapes
 *Shape of Animals	
 	*Mostly spherical with elongated extension
 	*Elongated extension are even and symmetrical to the other half
 	*Number of elongated extension modulos of 2,3,4,8..100(insects)
 	*Number of elongation is relative to size, bigger = lesser legs
 	
 *Shape of Plants /Trees
 	*Elongated spherical with elongated entensions
 	*number of elongation is fairly distributed around the circular peripheral
 	
##Gravity
	*affects the plants/animals

##Terrain
	Affected by the amount of solid,liquid,gas (which are also affected by temperature)
	Temperature is affected by the elements present in a system.



*Generating universe
	*Spawn possible elements in the universe
	*Rarity of elements take consideration
	*Volumes of each element is determined by a number series equation.
	*Distribute these elements accross the vast universe
	
*Generating galaxy, nebula
	*at this location (x,y,z) determine that percentage present of the elements.
	*determine the temperature at this location
	*temperature is determined by the volume percentage of gasses and other elements.
	*or temperature at each region is determined by the number series equation
	*base on the temperature, elements phases(solid,liquid,gas,plasma) is determined

*Generating celestial bodies, stars, planetary system, asteroids, moons, comets
	* base on the amount of solid elements, planets can be formed, asteroids and moons can also occur
	* the location of each of these celestial is determined by the mass of the celestial bodies
	* F = G(m1*m2)/r^2, G = 6.673×10−11 N · (m/kg)2
	* gravity is then determines for each celestial bodies.
	##Stars
		*combination of solid + gas which leads into plasma
	##asteroid - density of solid elements are mostly similar
	##planets - density of solids are a bit higher + liquids with closer densities
	##moons - similar to planets, but orbits a planet instead of a star
	##coments - smaller bodies composed of plasma
	##star - gas + plasma, huge mass, emits heat and light energy
	##planets may or may not rotate a star
		#lone planets, just floating not rotating around a body
		#ideally planets rotate around a star
		#stars rotate in a galaxy
		#galaxy rotates expands away from each other
	
*Generating planets
	*spherical
	*densiest elements settle to the center of the sphere
	*gradually not so denser ones settle farther out the sphere
	*mass is relative to how much volume percentage of solid in that certain region/location
		*stacking of amount of elements at definite volume accross the coordinates around the planet
		*mountains are the result of higher number of volumes at a certain coordinate
		*rocks can also be on the outer layer when during the settling process there were a lot of not soo dense materials block the rock from settling
		*sands are small rocks loosely gathered around the planets.(Also a result of abbrassion)
		
	
*Generating planet terrain
	*solid terrain to liquid terrain ratio is determined by the ratio of liquid to solid
	*elevated terrains(mountains) is determines by the ratio of hard solid to softer solids.
	*seas are determined by the solid to liquid ratios
	*river formation (a bit more complex)
		*rivers are formed when certain formation of liquid is at higher elevation, dragged by gravity
		*these are affected by the hydrolic cycle, a change of phase of liquid to gas then gas to liquid
		##Affected by
			*flow of heat (temperature changes)
			*rain - rains is formed by cycle change from liquid to gas, then gas to liquid
		*river fractals:
			*branching out or not is determined by a hard collision of solid terrain along its path
			*winding of river is also affected by a collision of hard terrain along its path
	
				
*Generating biomes
	*determining the likelihood of presence of biomes for a certain planet
		*depends on temperature
		*presence of elements necessary for life (C,H,O,N)
	*animals (CHON)
	*plants (CHO)

##http://a-z-animals.com/reference/animal-classification/
Biomes
	*Kingdom (Animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, protist)
	*Phylum (invertebrated, verterbrates, arthopods, molluscs, echinoderms)
	*Class (mammals, bony fish, cartilaginous fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles)
	*Order ({mammal}:[carnivora, primatem, artiodactyla, rodentia]
	*Family({carnivore}:Felidae(cats),Canidae(dogs),Ursidae(bears), mustelidae(weasles))
	*Genus (Felis(domestic cats), Panthera(Tigers, Leopards, Jaguar, Lions)
	*Species 

#Example of a species

Example 1 - Tiger
Kingdom: Animalia (Animal)
Phylum: Chordata (Vertebrate)
Class: Mammalia (Mammal)
Order: Carnivora (Carnivore)
Family: Felidae (Cat)
Genus: Panthera
Species: Panthera tigris (Tiger)	


Classification of these biomes can be generated from the equation of number series
*Animal characteristics
	-is determined by the presence of elements in the body
	*body mass
	*Physical structure
	*Hardness (~chemical composition, hardness of the elements, molecular bonds)
	*Texture
	*Color
	*Movement (~/mass, ~energy)
	*Energy level
	*Food chain (eats animals that contains elements these animal needs)
	
	
Human created contents:
	*Civilization are created by players
	*The found a nice place to settle in, build something on it
Crafting
	*Elements and naturally formed compounds can be crafted together to form a highly complex materials
	*These materials can be used by players to build structures such as cities
	*Buildings can be build using block by blocks, copy pastes, regular shape brush, bending elements
	*Source of materials can be simulated by mining/gathering of resources.
	*Mining process, takes the material away from the generated content and is transfered somewhere else.

Persistent world.
	*Data that is generated by the equation will always be persistent.
	*Data changes that is generated by user will have to be merged on top of the generated ones before rendering the content to the observer.
	

##Evolution?
	very complicated,close to impossible to implement, since you need to store the deltas of each parts.
	where am i gonna store that?

##Erosion/Rock formation
	If there are rates of changes derived from the series of numbers then we can calculate the volume loss, volume addition

##Growth
	-growth of organisms
	-since the structure of specifies is determined by the mass, we can simulate growth by adding increments of mass of these organism 
	-at a certain time duration( t1 ) mass = intialmass + (t1*increment)
	-law of conservation of mass still applies, since the animal will later on die then the mass is back to the planet
	-mortality rates
		-rate of spawns
		-conway game of life
